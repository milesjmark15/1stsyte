# About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm a 10-year-old who's super excited about learning web development! This is my first website, and I'm learning so much along the way.

## What I Love

- **Coding**: I'm learning HTML, CSS, and how websites work
- **Learning**: I love discovering new things every day
- **Creating**: Building something from scratch is amazing!
- **Sharing**: I want to show others what I'm learning

## My Learning Journey

I started this project because I wanted to learn how websites work. My dad helped me set up:
- A GitHub repository to store my code
- Hugo to build the website
- Netlify to make it live on the internet

## My Goals

1. **Learn Web Development**: Understand how websites are built
2. **Create Cool Content**: Add fun pages and blog posts
3. **Share My Progress**: Document what I'm learning
4. **Help Others**: Maybe inspire other kids to learn coding too!

## Fun Facts

- This is my very first website
- I'm learning Git to track my changes
- I think coding is like solving puzzles
- I can't wait to add more features!

Thanks for visiting my first website! ðŸŒŸ

# Welcome to 1stsyte! Terminus IV  ðŸŽ‰

Hi there! Welcome to my very first website! I'm learning how to build websites using Hugo, and this is my first attempt.

## What I'm Learning

- **Hugo**: A static site generator (fancy way to build websites fast!)
- **Git**: Keeping track of all my changes
- **GitHub**: Sharing my code with the world
- **Netlify**: Making my website live on the internet

## My Goals

1. âœ… Set up my first website
2. âœ… Learn about web development
3. âœ… Share my journey with others
4. ðŸ”„ Add more cool features
5. ðŸ”„ Write blog posts about what I learn

## Fun Facts About Me

- I'm 10 years old
- I love learning new things
- I'm excited to become a web developer
- This is my first real project!

## Test Update

This is a test to see if Netlify is building from the right repository! ðŸš€

Stay tuned for more updates as I learn and grow! ðŸš€
